				<h2>First Bicycle</h2>
				<p> ISTANBUL - The Draisienne or hobby horse.</p>
				<p>Dating back to the 19th century, the bicycle gained its name in France in 1817 when Baron von Drais invented what was referred to as the "walking machine." The vehicle was designed to have two similar sized wheels, one at the front that is steerable and one at the back. The device was propelled manually. The cyclist had to actually push their feet back and forth on the ground and glide while walking. The machine was named after its inventor and called the "Draisienne" or hobby horse. The hobby was short lived due to its impracticality.</p>

				<h2>Further Innovations</h2>
				<p> The evolution of the bicycle The Velocipede or 'boneshaker':</p>
				<p> This bicycle made its next appearance in 1865 as the velocipede. Pedals were applied directly to the front wheel making it better known as the "bone shaker" due to the turbulence it caused on the cobblestone road.</p>
				<p> The bicycle was still made of wood but eventually gained metal tires. It was at this stage that indoor riding rinks were invented to make the experience more enjoyable.</p>
